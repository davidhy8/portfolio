                <br>
                <p>Hi, I'm David! I am an data scientist and machine learning engineer with a diverse background in 
                    statistics and biology. My expertise lies in processing complex and noisy datasets, deriving insights 
                    through statistical methods, and predictive analysis with techniques such as machine learning and regression. As an advocate
                    for innovation, I hope to work alongside like-minded individuals on products that will revolutionize our future.<span id="dots">...</span>
                </p>
                <div id="more">
                    <br>
                    <h2 class="about-heading">My story</h2>
                    <p>
                        My innate curiosity to understand the underlying mechanisms behind the world around me led me to study a <span class="red-text">Bachelor's degree in Cellular, Molecular and Microbial Biology</span>. 
                        It was during my undergraduate studies where I stumbled upon the field of Bioinformatics which lays at the intersection between biological science, applied statistics and computer technology. 
                        As an undergraduate Bioinformatics researcher, I developed a data pipeline, <a href="https://github.com/nodrogluap/nybbler"><span class="red-text">Nybbler</span></a>, to perform targeted subsampling for genetic sequences of COVID-19. 
                        In addition, I also worked on other research projects including <a href="https://github.com/nodrogluap/minioncapstone"><span class="red-text">MinION</span></a>, which enables real-time genetic sequencing by utilizing GPU parallelization with CUDA, under the supervision of <a href="https://grad.ucalgary.ca/future-students/supervisor/paul-gordon"><span class="red-text">Dr. Paul Gordon</span></a> 
                        and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/quanlongresearch"><span class="red-text">Dr. Quan Long</span></a>. Aside from my involvement in academia, I was also recognized for my strong academic 
                        track record and campus involvement through the means of various <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-h-yang/details/honors/"><span class="red-text">awards</span></a>. During my studies, I hosted a medical conference, <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/5267735/calgary-medical-students-mentor-doctors/"><span class="red-text">MedX</span></a>; I was a faculty representative
                        on the <span class="red-text">First Year Council</span>; I also co-founded a national student-run, not-for-profit organization, 
                        <a href="https://www.couhr.ca/"><span class="red-text">COUHR</span></a>, which operates in 4 cities across Canada and led the <a href="https://www.couhr.ca/technology-development/"><span class="red-text">technological development</span></a> department within the organization to create a mobile health tracking application for patients with Alzheimer's disease.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After recognizing that the forefront of medical and biological innovation is empowered and driven by the use of big data and artificial intelligence, I was motivated to pursue a 
                        <span class="red-text">Master's degree in Mathematics and Statistics</span> to gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms behind such advancements. This transition from a non-traditional
                        background to a technical field involving robust mathematics, statistics, and computer science marked a difficult period in my academic journey. Through the guidance of my
                        peers and my supervisor, <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/qingrunzhang"><span class="red-text">Dr. Qingrun Zhang</span></a>, I was able to maintain my academic excellence while engaging in 
                        various meaningful machine learning and data analytics projects. With the use of statistical techniques such as machine learning, I identified various key genes and biomarkers associated with diseases such as <a href="https://github.com/davidhy8/exploratory-macaque"><span class="red-text">Glaucoma</span></a>
                        and <span class="red-text">Cancer</span>. Meanwhile, I also devised and developed a novel <a href="https://github.com/davidhy8/parallel-phylogenetics"><span class="red-text">optimization method</span></a> which reduced run-times for evolutionary analysis by more than 2800%. 
                        Currently, I am actively searching for career opportunities involving data science and machine learning where I can employ my skills and leave a significant impact. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Outside of this, owing to my affinity for novelty, I hold many scattered interests in subjects such as artificial intelligence, finance, biotechnology, music and reading. Recently,
                        the book that left the strongest impression on me was <a href="https://www.navalmanack.com/"><span class="red-text">The Almanack of Naval Ravikant</span></a>. I also make <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@testautomation2243"><span class="red-text">YouTube</span></a> tutorials for
                        Web Automation Development which have currently accumulated more than 50,000 views. Finally, I am very passionate about playing basketball and volleyball, and always enjoy a stimulating conservation!
